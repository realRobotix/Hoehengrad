# Höhengrad

Höhengrad is a Background shader entirely written in [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)).  
It's using a custom [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) implementation as a base which is then used to create the layers.\
The entire image also gets some film grain applied to it to avoid color banding.
